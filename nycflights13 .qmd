## Task 1
### 1.1 Github  repo named [nycflights13](https://github.com/firdauz-bk/nycflights13)

### 1.2 Insert Screenshot

### 1.3 flights db connected

### 1.4 SQL Code:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
-- Import table for planes
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS planes CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE planes (
    tailnum VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    year INT,
    type VARCHAR(255),
    manufacturer VARCHAR(255),
    model VARCHAR(255),
    engines INT,
    seats INT,
    speed INT,
    engine VARCHAR(255)
);

COPY planes
FROM 'C:\Users\Chanj\OneDrive - Singapore Institute Of Technology\Areas\T3Y1\AAI1001 Data engineering and visualisation\week 4\nycflights13\data\planes.csv'
CSV HEADER;
```

## Task 2: Aggregating Information from the flights Table

### 2.1 
```{sql}
#| connection: con_nycflights13

WITH nyc_airports AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT origin
    FROM flights
    WHERE origin IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR')
),
dest_count AS (
    SELECT
        f.origin AS airport_code,
        a.name AS airport_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT f.dest) AS num_destinations
    FROM flights f
    INNER JOIN airports a ON f.origin = a.faa
    WHERE f.origin IN (SELECT origin FROM nyc_airports)
    GROUP BY f.origin, a.name
),
ranked_airports AS (
    SELECT
        airport_code,
        airport_name,
        num_destinations,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY num_destinations DESC, airport_code ASC) AS rank
    FROM dest_count
)
SELECT
    airport_code,
    airport_name,
    num_destinations,
    rank
FROM ranked_airports
ORDER BY rank, airport_code;
