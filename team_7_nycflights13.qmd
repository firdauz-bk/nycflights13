        f.dep_delay,
        w.precip
    FROM 
        flights f
    JOIN 
        weather w 
    ON 
        f.origin = w.origin 
        AND f.year = w.year

```{sql}
#| connection: con_nycflights13

WITH low_visibility_delay AS (
    SELECT 
        f.origin AS airport_code,
        a.name AS airport_name,
        AVG(f.dep_delay) AS mean_departure_delay

    GROUP BY 
        f.origin, a.name
)
SELECT 
    airport_code,
    airport_name,
    ROUND(mean_departure_delay, 2) AS mean_departure_delay,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY mean_departure_delay) AS rank

    low_visibility_delay
ORDER BY 
    rank, airport_code;
```
### 4.4
What is the correlation coefficient between the mean temperature of the day and the mean departure delay on that day? Round the value to two decimal places. Provide the answer in the form of a table with one row and one column. Hint: calculate the AVG() of temperature for each day in 2013, and then the AVG() of departure delay for each day in 2013. After that, calculate the CORR() between these two sequences (of length 365 or less). Remember to INNER JOIN flights and weather.
```{sql}
#| connection: con_nycflights13
SELECT ROUND(CORR(avg_temp, avg_dep_delay):: numeric, 2) AS correlation_coefficient
FROM (
    SELECT f.year, f.month, f.day,
           AVG(w.temp) AS avg_temp,
           AVG(f.dep_delay) AS avg_dep_delay
    FROM flights AS f
    INNER JOIN weather AS w ON f.origin = w.origin
                             AND f.year = w.year
                             AND f.month = w.month
                             AND f.day = w.day
    WHERE f.year = 2013
    GROUP BY f.year, f.month, f.day
) AS subquery
LIMIT 4;

```

Burlington, Vermont, lies almost exactly to the north of New York City. Is the mean flight time to Burlington International Airport (BTV) shorter when the wind blows from the south (between 135 and 225 degrees) compared to when it blows from the north (between 0 and 45 degrees as well as between 315 and 360 degrees)? Provide your answer in the form of a table with one row each for north and south winds, and two columns, named wind_direction and mean_air_time. Hint: CASE expression.
```{sql}
#| connection: con_nycflights13
WITH burlington_flights AS (
    SELECT
        f.origin,
        f.air_time,
        CASE
            WHEN w.wind_dir BETWEEN 135 AND 225 THEN 'South'
            WHEN w.wind_dir BETWEEN 0 AND 45 OR w.wind_dir BETWEEN 315 AND 360 THEN 'North'
            ELSE NULL
        END AS wind_direction
    FROM
        flights f
    JOIN
        weather w ON f.origin = w.origin
    WHERE
        f.dest = 'BTV'

SELECT
    wind_direction,
    AVG(air_time) AS mean_air_time
